<h1>Ch 7 - Configuring Enterprise Applications</h1>
<p>All build targets create an application server configuration
named <code> security</code>. After the build, to run the application
server, open another command window, <code>cd</code> to the applications
server's <code>bin</code> directory, and enter:</p>
<table class="command">
	<tr>
		<td class="commandText">./run.sh -c enterprise</td>
		<td>(Linux)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="commandText">run -c enterprise</td>
		<td>(Windows)</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>None of the targets creates a database.</p>
<hr />

<table class="target">
	<tr>
		<th>Target:</th>
		<td class="targetNumber">01</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Section:</th>
		<td>7.2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Description:</th>
		<td>Builds and packages a simple client-server greeting
		application as demonstrated in the walk-through in section 7.2.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th colspan="2">After the build:</th>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Run the <code>ant 01-client</code> target to run the client
application that will produce the following output on the client: <br />
<br />
<code> <pre>
     [java] Hello, world!
     [java] Hola, mundo!
     [java] Salam, donya!
     [java] Bonjour, monde!
     [java] Ciao, mondo!

	<tr>
		<th>Section:</th>
		<td>7.4.1 & 7.4.2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Description:</th>
		<td>Builds and packages a series of simple EJBs that bind into
		JNDI in different ways.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th colspan="2">After the build:</th>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Run the <code>ant 02-client</code> target to run the client
application that will try to call the various EJBs. If you look on the
JBoss console, you'll see the following output:<br />
<br />
<code> <pre>
INFO [STDOUT] Remote call to default printer successful.
INFO [STDOUT] Local call to default printer successful.
INFO [STDOUT] Remote call to annotation printer (with first bound name) successful.
INFO [STDOUT] Local call to annotation printer successful.
INFO [STDOUT] Remote call to annotation printer (with second bound name) successful.
INFO [STDOUT] Local call to annotation printer successful.
INFO [STDOUT] Remote call to config printer successful.
INFO [STDOUT] Remote call to config printer successful.
INFO [STDOUT] Remote call to override printer successful.
INFO [STDOUT] Local call to override printer successful.
</pre> </code> <br />
The interesting thing here is not the output, but rather the code /
configuration. Look through the client and EJB code (and read section
7.4.1 & 7.4.2 of the book) to see the different ways that EJBs can be
bound into JNDI, and how they can be looked up.</p>

<p class="warning">WARNING: Overriding the JNDI binding annotations using the XML deployment 
descriptor does not work in JBoss 5.0 GA. Hopefully, this will be fixed in a patch release,
but until then we have commented out the client code that calls the bean with the overridden
binding.</p>

Navigate to the <code>jbia:service=interestRateManager</code> service
and change the interest rate to a different number (e.g. 7.55). Then go
back to the application and try calculating again. You'll see that the
interest rate has changed.</p>

<p>Run the <code>ant 06-client</code> target to run the client

that has security annotations set on it. Open the source code for this
class to see what annotations are set.</p>

<p>The client will try to access the EJB using four different users
that have different roles. Look at the <code>src/alt/07/resources/myroles.properties</code>
file to see what roles these user have (the 07-client output will print
this out too).</p>

shows you that logging into a web application will propagate the
security credentials to the EJB server as well.

<p>Next run the <code>ant 08-client</code> target to run the client
application which will download the SSL-based EJB proxy and call the server. Note that the client runs with the following arguments, which point to the client trust store:</p>
<code>java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStrore=c:\jbia-src\ch07\target/keystore/client.truststore -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=clientpass com.manning.jbia.Client</code>
