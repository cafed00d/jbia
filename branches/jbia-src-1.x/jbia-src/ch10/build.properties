# This is a supplemental properties file for the JBoss Portal examples. This
# file superceedes the master properties file and is used to set the JBoss AS
# home property to a 4.2.x version because Portal does not yet run on AS 5.


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Set the following properties to the locations of the various JBoss components.

# JBoss Portal does not run on JBoss AS 5.0.0 at this time. Therefore, you
# need to specify the location of the JBoss AS 4.2.x binary ZIP file. If you
# are using jboss-4.2.3.GA-jdk6.zip, you must first rename the file to
# jboss-4.2.3.GA.zip because the build script expects that the ZIP file name
# matches the base directory name.
jboss.zip=/opt/jboss/download/jboss-4.2.3.GA.zip
