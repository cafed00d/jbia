# This is the master properties file which contains properties that you should
# set to reflect your environment.


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Set the following properties to the locations of the various JBoss components.

# The build targets install the JBoss Application Server. Set this property to
# the directory into which the target should install JBoss AS. For example, if
# you set this property to /opt, then JBoss AS will be installed at
# /opt/jboss-5.0.1.GA
jboss.base=/opt/jbia

# Full path for the JBoss Application Server binary ZIP file. The examples
# require version 5.0.0.GA or 5.0.1.GA. Note that the ZIP file name must be
# jboss-5.0.0.GA.zip or jboss-5.0.1.GA.zip (depending on version) because the
# base file name must match the name of the base directory within the ZIP file.
# For example, this means that if you are using the ZIP file for use with JDK 6
# (such as jboss-5.0.1.GA-jdk6.zip), you must rename it to jboss-5.0.1.GA.zip
# before referencing it here.
jboss.zip=/opt/jboss/download/jboss-5.0.1.GA.zip

# Directory where JBoss Portal binary was unzipped. The 2.7.x or 2.6.6 version is
# recommended (earlier 2.6.x versions might work also). You can leave this blank
# if you are not working on the portal examples. Note that this is the location
# of the Portal binary, not the Portal + JBossAS bundle!
home.portal=/opt/jboss/portal/jboss-portal-2.7.2

# Directory where JBoss Native binary was unpackaged. The 2.0.6 version is
# recommended in most cases. You can leave this blank if you are not working on
# the production chapter example that uses this. We have tried the build using
# JBoss AS 5.0.0.GA and various versions of JBoss Native on various operating
# systems; here are our findings:
# 1) Windows 32-bit: Neither JBoss Native 2.0.4 or 2.0.6 work; both complain
#    of a missing entry point in one of the DLLs. However, you still need to
#    provide a location to build the example that uses JBoss Native - the build
#    expects it.
# 2) Linux 64-bit: Works with JBoss Native 2.0.5, but not 2.0.6.
# 3) Windows 64 bit, Linux 32-bit: Both work with JBoss Native 2.0.6
# NOTE: This directory should contain only the JBoss Native package contents. Do
#       NOT extract JBoss Native into JBOSS_HOME and then reference JBOSS_HOME
#       here.
home.native=/opt/jboss/download/jboss-native-2.0.6-windows-x86-ssl
#home.native=/opt/jboss/download/jboss-native-2.0.6-windows-x64-ssl
#home.native=/opt/jboss/download/jboss-native-2.0.6-linux2-x86-ssl
#home.native=/opt/jboss/download/jboss-native-2.0.5-linux2-x64-ssl

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Set the following properties to the locations of the various security tools.

# The full path to the keytool executable. This should ship with your JRE/JDK.
keytool.executable=/opt/java/bin/keytool

# The full path to the openssl executable. You'll have to download this from the
# internet.
# For Windows, you can install openssl through Cygwin or download it from:
#      http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
# For Unix, you can get it from: http://www.openssl.org
openssl.executable=/opt/openssl/bin/openssl

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following properties relate to the database used for many of the examples.
# Set the following properties to reflect your database environment.

# Uncomment the line for the database you are using. Hypersonic is the default.
#database.type=mysql
#database.type=postgresql
database.type=hsqldb

# The full path name of the JDBC driver JAR file. We already know where the
# Hypersonic (hsqldb) JAR is located, no need to specify that.
mysql.jar=/opt/m2_repo/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.6/mysql-connector-java-5.1.6.jar
postgresql.jar=/opt/m2_repo/postgresql/postgresql/8.3-603.jdbc3/postgresql-8.3-603.jdbc3.jar

# Provide an account, and its password, that has the right to create users and
# databases. This is typically an administration account. We know this
# information for hsqldb, no need to specify it.
mysql.user=root
mysql.password=
postgresql.user=postgres
postgresql.password=
